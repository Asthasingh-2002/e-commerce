# Ecommerce React + Vite Project

This project uses [React](https://react.dev/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR). ESLint is included for code quality.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your system:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
